Two-factor authentication, often referred to colloquially as two-step verification, serves to enhance credential security during login processes across platforms such as Facebook and online banking, among others. While 2FA has significantly improved the security of the login and registration processes, it is noteworthy that its adoption tends to be more prevalent among younger individuals. Unfortunately, an increasing number of financial scams target older individuals who may be disinclined to engage with what they perceive as the complexity of multi-step authentication and password confirmation. Subsequent chapters provide a discussion of the various types of two-factor authentication, furnish detailed descriptions, and offer a summary of the benefits and gains achievable through the deployment of 2FA.}, number={1}, journal={Advances in Web Development Journal}, author={Izabela Szczygieł and Sebastian Florczak and Adrian Jasiak}, year={2023}, month={Oct.} }
